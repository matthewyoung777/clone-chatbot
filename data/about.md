# About Me

## Background

I am a full-stack software engineer with a background in economics and a passion for building engaging and functional applications. After graduating from Hack Reactor’s intensive 19-week program, they have been focused on expanding their skills by improving past projects, adding new features, and exploring new frameworks and tools. With experience in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy crafting intuitive user interfaces while also designing efficient APIs. Their work spans across multiple domains, from fitness and AI-driven chatbots to stock trading simulations, showcasing their versatility and problem-solving abilities.

## Education

For undergrad, I went to the University of Washington in Seattle. While I was there I majored in Economics, with an emphasis on statistics, data analysis, and programming as well. After working for a few years, I gained an increased interest in technology which drove me to join HackReactor, a full stack software developer bootcamp. HackReactor is a 5 month 10hr/day very intensive program where I learned how to work collaboratively with other developers, and gain a skillset in producing applications from the ground up in python and javascript.

## Present

Currently, I am working on Forge Fitness, a gamified workout app that blends fitness motivation with game mechanics. I am also developing Clone-Chatbot, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project designed to replicate their own knowledge and experiences. Our approach to development is hands-on and iterative, preferring to deeply understand concepts rather than follow tutorials. Beyond software engineering, I enjoy dystopian and sci-fi TV shows, strategic games, and continuously working on side projects that merge their love for technology and creativity.

## Side Projects & Tech Interests

One of my hobbies is working on **side projects**, especially combining tech and fitness. Right now, I'm building **Forge Fitness**, a workout app, with a couple of friends. We're trying to bring game mechanics into the fitness space to make working out more engaging and motivating.
I'm also working on this app, a RAG clone of myself that I want to be able to talk as if it were myself!

## Hobbys

### NBA Basketball (Golden State Warriors)

I'm a big fan of the **Golden State Warriors** and have been for a long time, starting 2006 when watching the we believe team. Watching Steph Curry's development has been my favorite part of being a warrior fan over the years.

## RAG Clone chatbot Project

### Overview

The goal of this project is to use python, RAG, LLMs and AI to create a chatbot AI of myself that can answer questions about me and my background, my work history, projects, interests etc.

### Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI (python)
Database: PostgreSQL pgvector for vector store
LLM API: OpenAI gpt4o-mini
Embedding Model: OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
Deployment: Render (backend hosting)

### Features

- **Knowledge Base**

A collection of structured and unstructured data (e.g., resumes, project descriptions, work experience, personal interests).
Documents will be embedded into a vector database for efficient retrieval.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

When a user asks a question, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant information from your knowledge base.
The retrieved context is then used to enhance the response generated by the LLM.
